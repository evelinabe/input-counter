# Refapp React+Typescript work sample exercise for developers 

This small repo contains instructions on a small hands-on exercise for candidates applying to a developer position at
[Refapp](https://refapp.com).

## Overall goal
Your task is to create a standalone ReactJS+Typescript web page application that can be served from the command line (static html or via a small web server).

The functionality of the web page is for the user to be able to submit a block of text and via a simulation
of a slow external API receive the number
of characters and words in the text for display.

## Constraints

You must write all code in Typescript, create functional ReactJS components
and use components from the material-ui library instead of builtin html elements.

The simulated external API is provided via an `analysis.ts` source code file next to this Readme file. There is no need for any backend server.

## What to focus on
The design should be nice but donâ€™t overdo it.
The code should be clean and legible.


## Prerequisites

These are the technologies you need use in order to successfully complete the task:

* npm
* Typescript
* ReactJS
* Material-ui.com (version 4 or 5)

## How to submit the results

Package up your project directory, along with instructions on how to run the project, into a zip file and email to your contact person at Refapp

### OR

Send a public link to your solution hosted on a git provider (e.g. github or gitlab)
